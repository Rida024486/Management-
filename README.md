# Exam Project: Film Data Analysis
Joining Tables: 
The first query connects three tables: "films," "imdb_scores," and "rotten_tomatoes_scores." Based on that, we can compile detailed information on each movie, including its film ID, title, critic reviews, and IMDb rating, by integrating these tables. With the use of this query, we can evaluate films taking into account a variety of rating sources, giving us a more complete picture of how well they performed and were received.


Wow, Factor Score: 
The second query adds the IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes audience, and Rotten Tomatoes critic scores to determine the "Wow Factor" score for each movie. This rating is an overall figure that includes the well-known IMDb rating in addition to reviews from critics and general viewers. We may find the films that have received a lot of overall praise and appeal from various rating sources by sorting the films according to wow factor scores in descending order.


Perfect Scores in All Categories:
The third query seeks to find films from a specified period that can achieve a perfect score (10) in all three rating categories: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes audience score, and Rotten Tomatoes critic score. This query will help us find extraordinary films that have received universal praise across many rating sites and by specifying the period, we will be able to focus on films released during a particular period of interest.


Correlation Between Title Length and IMDb Score: 
The fourth query wants to look for a connection between the length of a film's title and its IMDb score. We can determine whether there is a link between title length and audience reaction by categorising films based on their title length and determining the average IMDb score for each category. The data gathered can assist us in determining whether particular sorts of film titles tend to receive higher IMDb ratings, thus revealing insights into audience preferences and expectations.


Top Genres by Rotten Tomatoes Audience Score: 
The fifth query seeks to identify the top genres based on the Rotten Tomatoes audience score. We can discover genres that have regularly received good responses from public audiences by calculating the average audience score, average critic score, and average IMDb score for each genre and sorting the results by the total of the audience scores in decreasing order. This data helps us to determine which genres tend to resonate most positively with audiences, which may help influence film development and distribution decisions.


Film Count by Release Year: 
The sixth query summarises the number of films released per year. We may determine trends in film production and analyse any swings or patterns in film release volumes over time by categorising films based on their release year and counting the occurrences for each year. Such analysis can assist in understanding the evolution of the film business, identifying peak production years, and providing insights into the increase or fall of film releases during certain periods.


Films with the highest audience score on Rotten Tomatoes:
The seventh query gives the film ID, title, and Rotten Tomatoes audience score for the films with the highest Rotten Tomatoes audience score. This query identifies films that have gotten excellent reviews from public audiences on Rotten Tomatoes. We may focus on films that have connected strongly with audiences and have the potential to build a substantial following by concentrating on the audience score.


Films having the highest critic score on Rotten Tomatoes:
The eighth inquiry reveals films with the highest critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. We can find films that have received outstanding critical praise by getting the film ID, film name, and critic score. This query identifies films that have received high marks and accolades from expert film reviewers, demonstrating their quality and aesthetic worth.


Films having the highest IMDb rating:
The ninth query collects the film ID, film name, and IMDb score to provide a list of films with the highest IMDb score.


Each film's IMDb rating:
The tenth query displays each film's IMDb score by getting the film ID, film name, and IMDb score from the "films" and "imdb_scores" tables.
